# Reddit Sans Font Specimen

The specimen is a small [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) site.
It requires `node` in order to build specimen.

```bash
# install the project dependencies
npm install

# run the build and server locally
npm start
```

View the site at http://localhost:3000/

## Preview the production build

```bash
# run the production build
npm run build
npm run serve
```

The build script also runs `npm run archive`, which creates a downloadable ZIP
archive of fonts and additional resources. This is added to the build directory.
