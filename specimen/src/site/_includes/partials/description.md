Reddit is a place where real people come together to discuss their interests and share their stories. So a typeface for Reddit cannot just focus on how a brand communicates with its audience. The fonts need to work first and foremost for Redditors, allowing them to speak in their own individual voices in a way that feels both natural and authentic.

For a community with such diverse interests, this is no mean feat. But our approach puts a focus on this human element.

We wanted a typeface that captures the best of Reddit. Something approachable and warm, smart and modern, and—of course—a bit quirky.

The typeface draws inspiration from timeless designs throughout the twentieth century, distilling them into something unique yet universal. There are specific nods to Renner's Futura, Middleton's Tempo, Edward Johnston and Pischner's Neuzeit, but contemporary touches set it apart.

The design is based on a geometric structure that leans towards classical proportions. Minimal contrast between vertical and horizontal strokes add a warm appearance. Loose, low tension curves mix a friendly charm with open apertures and occassional dashes of cursive flair. The x-height is tall enough for comfortable reading at smaller text sizes, but the letter forms don't compromise on graphic appeal when writ large.

The fonts include a wide range of glyphs covering extended Latin character sets and offering support for a variety of OpenType features. Five weights are available, with matching italics.

Best of all, Reddit Sans is generously licenced, so you're free to download and use the fonts as you like.
